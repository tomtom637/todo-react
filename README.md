# Todo-react

## Presentation

Here is a simple proof of concept for a todo application in ReactJs.

A user can create lists of tasks, mark them as completed, update or delete them as well as describing their urgency with color tags.

Although it doesn't have a backend nor a database, it uses the localStorage to persist the data.
